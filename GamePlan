1. Apache Spark
--> no priority (all sentences are even)
--> first sentence only
--> first sentence and last sentence only
--> middle only
--> 65% first and last 35% Middle
--> take the most heavily weighted sentence only for every sentence in the review
--> take the most heavily weighted sentence for the review -> weight this 80% and then 20% for the rest

2. MapReduce
--> do the best one in MapReduce and compare the bandwidth to Apache Spark
